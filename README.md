This is a project that can get all of your data and send it to a website.
# How is that even possible?
It uses a API from ipapi.co and fetches a JSON that can grab every aspect of your information and send it to a website (via POST)
# When does the source code and IPA get published?
I have no idea. This takes time. If I can't make the project correctly then sorry!
